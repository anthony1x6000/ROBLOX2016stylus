If you don't already, this requires stylus to function. Get it at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or the [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) website. <br> [Userscript](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus#mirrors) is also supported, though not 100% tested.<br>

## Contributing
**If you can, please contribute!**<br>
If you know how to fix anything that hasn't been already fixed or see anything that could be improved, I encourage you to create a fork or make a pull request and fix it! I don't know much CSS myself, so any contribution, even improving the slightest little thing, is greatly appreciated!

### Browser Compatability
- [Brave](https://brave.com/) & most Chromium browsers
- [Firefox](https://firefox.com/) (This style is built around the [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) and because Firefox uses a different browser engine, [Gecko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28software%29), the style may not work properly, though I will fix bugs on the Firefox browser. 
### Display Compatability
Your display/monitor has to be AT LEAST **1024 pixels wide** for this style to work correctly. 
I'd recommend at least a 1366 x 768 monitor or, even better, a 1920 x 1080 monitor.
I could try and fix this, but that's too much work. You can try to fix it if you want.
