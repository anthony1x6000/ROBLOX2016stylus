## Hello, User(script)

[**HELLO, [USER]**](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) - I probably should have announced this a while ago, but I made a [Userscript](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) that **brings back the Hello, User stuff on the home page**. Go check it out! Works with and without the Roblox 2016 style.

## Changes/Fixes 
- [Icon padding | x2 ] Optional 2016 icon padding. You will see why it will be optional. 
- [BTR ROBLOX Profile] Fix groups tiles when viewing someones profile with better roblox.
- [Robux Page] Clean up robux page.
- [BTR ROBLOX Game Description] Fix game description when using BTR ROBLOX.
- [Navbar] Update navbar to say 'Games' and 'ROBUX' instead of 'Charts' and 'Robux.' Fixed again 08/25 to bring back "ROBUX."
- [Sign-up] Fix logo position on sign-up page.
- [Sign-up] Fix background colors.
- [Experience Page] Patch-up game tiles. Won't attempt to bring back the older, thinner tiles.
- [Home Page] Fixed game card width again.
- [Home Page] Add background to friends list. 
- [Home Page] Remove "Today's Picks." The removal is not final.
- [Games Page] Fixed button coloring/shadowing.
