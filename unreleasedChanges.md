## Site breaking changes
- [WEBSITE CHAT] Fixed website chat (background color not applying properly)
- [BETTER ROBLOX] Big thanks to [Diyamund](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues/7) for making BTRoblox icons to be consistent with 2016. 
- [FONT FIXES] Another fix thanks to [Diyamund](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/issues/8); implemented similar, but different font faces. 
- [AVATAR PAGE SIDEBAR FIX] Some stuff (paid games button) conflicted with the headers on the side. I guess Roblox decided to make both of them have the same classes, idk.
## Small Changes
- [LEFT SIDE BAR] Centered (shrunk) the left sidebar.

## Known bugs
- Under profile pages, the about section and the report section don't correctly splice together. I'll try working on a fix for that when I have the time.
