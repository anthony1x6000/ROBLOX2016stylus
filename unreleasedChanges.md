## Hello, User(script)

[**HELLO, [USER]**](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) - I probably should have announced this a while ago, but I made a [Userscript](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) that **brings back the Hello, User stuff on the home page**. Go check it out! Works with and without the Roblox 2016 style.

## Changes/Fixes 
- [Icon padding | x2 ] Optional 2016 icon padding. You will see why it will be optional. 
- [BTR ROBLOX Profile] Fix groups tiles when viewing someones profile with better roblox.
- [Robux Page] Clean up robux page.
