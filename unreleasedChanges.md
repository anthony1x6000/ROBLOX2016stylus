## Hello, User(script)

[**HELLO, [USER]**](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) - I probably should have announced this a while ago, but I made a [Userscript](https://github.com/anthony1x6000/ROBLOX2016stylus/blob/main/helloUser.user.js) that **brings back the Hello, User stuff on the home page**. Go check it out! Works with and without the Roblox 2016 style.

## Changes/Fixes 
- [Avatar Page] Setting cog fix on Outfits page. 
- [Avatar Page] Fix "Explore the catalog to find more clothes!" 
- [Avatar Page] Modify font weight and text of "Avatar Editor" 
- [Avatar Page] Touch up avatar redraw (line height).
